# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Data Science: Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy facilitate data analysis and manipulation.

Python's popularity lies in its simplicity, extensive libraries, and broad applicability across different fields of programming and development.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Download Python Installer:

Go to python.org and download the latest Python installer (python-3.x.x.exe).
Run Installer:

Open the downloaded file and select "Add Python 3.x to PATH" during installation.
Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt and type:
bash

Copy code
python --version
You should see the installed Python version.
Set Up Virtual Environment:

Install virtualenv:
bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Create a new virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
virtualenv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
bash

Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   print("Hello, World!")

Explanation:
Print Statement:
The print() function in Python is used to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes, specifying the text to be printed.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without decimals, like age = 25.

Float (float): Represents numbers with decimals or scientific notation, such as pi = 3.14.

String (str): Represents sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes, like name = "Alice".

Boolean (bool): Represents truth values True or False, typically used in conditional statements, e.g., is_student = True.

List (list): Represents ordered collections of items that can be of mixed data types, e.g., numbers = [1, 2, 3].

# Define variables of different data types
age = 25           # integer
height = 1.75      # float
name = "Alice"     # string
is_student = True  # boolean
grades = [85, 90, 88, 92, 95]  # list

# Print variables and their types
print(f"age: {age}, type: {type(age)}")
print(f"height: {height}, type: {type(height)}")
print(f"name: {name}, type: {type(name)}")
print(f"is_student: {is_student}, type: {type(is_student)}")
print(f"grades: {grades}, type: {type(grades)}")

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Prov

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.

**Example of an `if-else` statement:**

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not yet an adult.")
```
  - The `if` statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to `18`.
  - If the condition (`age >= 18`) is `True`, it executes the first indented block (`print("You are an adult.")`).
  - If the condition is `False`, it executes the second indented block (`print("You are not yet an adult.")`).

Loops in Python are used to iterate over sequences (like lists, tuples, or strings) and perform actions repeatedly.
xample of a for loop:

python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
Explanation:
The for loop iterates over each element (num) in the numbers list.
During each iteration, num takes on the value of each element in sequence.
The print(num) statement within the loop body prints each number in the list.


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions in Python are blocks of code that perform a specific task or calculation. They allow you to:

Modularize: Break down tasks into smaller, reusable parts.
Reuse: Use the same code multiple times without duplication.
Abstract: Focus on what the function does rather than how it does it.
Example: Adding Two Numbers
python

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Function to add two numbers."""
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8
Explanation:
def add_numbers(a, b): defines a function named add_numbers that takes parameters a and b.
return a + b returns the sum of a and b.
result = add_numbers(5, 3) calls the function with arguments 5 and 3.
print("Sum:", result) prints the sum, which is 8.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   ### Lists and Dictionaries in Python

#### Differences:

- **Lists (`list`)**:
  - Ordered collection of items accessed by index.
  - Elements are indexed by integers starting from 0.
  - Syntax: `[item1, item2, item3, ...]`
  - Example:
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
  
- **Dictionaries (`dict`)**:
  - Unordered collection of key-value pairs accessed by keys.
  - Keys are unique identifiers typically strings or numbers.
  - Syntax: `{key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}`
  - Example:
    ```python
    person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
    ```

#### Basic Operations Example:

```python
# List operations
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("First number:", numbers[0])    # Accessing an element
numbers.append(6)                     # Adding an element
numbers.remove(3)                     # Removing an element
print("Updated numbers list:", numbers)

# Dictionary operations
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
print("Person's name:", person['name'])  # Accessing a value
person['email'] = 'alice@example.com'    # Adding a key-value pair
del person['city']                      # Deleting a key-value pair
print("Updated person dictionary:", person)
```

### Summary:

- **Lists** are ordered and accessed by index.
- **Dictionaries** are unordered and accessed by keys.
  
These data structures offer flexibility in organizing and manipulating data in Python programs, catering to different needs and scenarios.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   
### Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling in Python allows you to manage and respond to errors (exceptions) that occur during program execution, preventing your program from crashing.

#### Example Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` Blocks:

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
    print("Division result:", x)  # This line will not execute
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
```

- **`try` block**: Contains code that might raise an exception.
- **`except` block**: Handles specific exceptions (`ZeroDivisionError` in this case) that occur within the `try` block.
- **`finally` block**: Executes cleanup code that should always run, whether an exception occurred or not.



9. ### Modules and Packages in Python

#### Concepts:

- **Modules**: Individual Python files containing code that can be reused in other Python scripts.

- **Packages**: Directories that contain multiple Python modules, providing a hierarchical structure for organizing code.

#### Example Using the `math` Module:

```python
# Example using the math module
import math

# Using functions from the math module
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)          # Accessing constant
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))  # Using function
```

#### Explanation:

- **Importing `math` module**: `import math` allows access to functions and constants defined in the `math` module.
  
- **Accessing constants and functions**: `math.pi` provides the value of Ï€, and `math.sqrt(16)` computes the square root of 16 using functions from the `math` 


10. File I/O:
    - ### Reading from a File and Writing to a File in Python

#### Reading from a File

```python
# Reading from a file and printing content to console
file_path = 'sample.txt'

try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("File Content:")
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")
except IOError:
    print(f"Error: Could not read from the file '{file_path}'.")
```

#### Writing to a File

```python
# Writing a list of strings to a file
output_file = 'output.txt'
data_to_write = ["Hello, World!", "This is a test.", "Python is awesome!"]

try:
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for line in data_to_write:
            file.write(line + "\n")
    print(f"Data successfully written to '{output_file}'.")
except IOError:
    print(f"Error: Could not write to the file '{output_file}'.")
```

### Summary

- **Reading from a File**: Use `open()` with `'r'` mode and `read()` method to read file content.
- **Writing to a File**: Use `open()` with `'w'` mode and `write()` method to write data to a file.
- **Error Handling**: Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors like file not found or IO errors.
